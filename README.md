The advent of the World Wide Web brought far reaching changes in human computer
interaction, and mobility is doing the same. Turning knobs and flicking switches
became pressing keys and moving a mouse. This in turn has become touching
screens and swiping. And this is only the beginning.

JavaScript development is acclimatizing itself to a new keyboard- and
mouse-free, screen-orientated mainstream. But what happens to web development
when new categories of devices mean that even the touch-screen cannot be
assumed?

Computer user interfaces change. What remains the same, however, is the human
body that drives interaction. So this talk will discuss an experiment that
explores developing touch-less human computer interaction with JavaScript for
content creation on a mobile World Wide Web
